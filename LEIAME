- Fork:
    * creates a process with a parent
    * receive a int tickets, only receive the follow numbers: 50, 100, 200, 400.
    * returns a error if receive a NULL or differente number

- Stride Scheduler
    * In this implementation, scheduler select the smaller stride runnable process to put in cpu
    * After running, the stride of the process is plus by 400/nTickets
    * All process, start with stride 0 and the tiebreaker is the pid of the process

- Run Test
    * To run the test code, compile and run xv6 and tip the command "teste"
    * Gonna be running 9 process with differents number of tickets
    * Each one print a message where end running
